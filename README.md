# üè† Kubernetes Homelab: A Production-Ready Learning Journey

> *A modern, GitOps-driven Kubernetes homelab built for learning, experimenting, and having fun with enterprise-grade technologies in a home environment.*

This project represents a comprehensive Kubernetes homelab implementation that follows 2025 best practices, combining the thrill of learning cutting-edge technologies with the satisfaction of running a rock-solid home infrastructure. It's designed as both a learning platform and a production-ready deployment that can scale from a single node to a multi-node cluster.

## üéØ Why This Project Exists

I built this homelab because **I find this stuff super fun!** There's something pretty magical about that moment when it just works. And I really use it! I am pushing for 100% data freedom and this platform helps quite a bit.

This isn't just infrastructure ‚Äì it's a playground for exploring the latest in cloud-native technologies while running real applications that I use daily.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This homelab follows a **"crawl, walk, run"** philosophy, starting with minimal viable infrastructure and progressively adding capabilities. Every component is declarative, version-controlled, and follows GitOps principles from day one.

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Why This Choice |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Kubernetes Distribution** | k3s | Production-grade with <100MB footprint, perfect for homelab |
| **Load Balancer** | MetalLB | Enables LoadBalancer services on bare metal |
| **Ingress Controller** | HAProxy | Honestly just to learn it |
| **GitOps** | ArgoCD | Industry standard with "app of apps" pattern |
| **Certificate Management** | cert-manager + Let's Encrypt | Automatic TLS certificates for all services |
| **Container Runtime** | containerd | k3s default, lightweight and reliable |

### Network Architecture

                      ‚Üë
                 MetalLB LoadBalancer
```

**Ingress Classes:**
- `haproxy-public`: External-facing services with full TLS
- `haproxy-restricted`: Internal services with network restrictions

## üÜï Recent Cluster Changes

- Added a second node to form a two-node cluster (control plane remains single-writer/non-HA).
- Longhorn deployed and all application storage migrated to Longhorn; volumes are replicated across both nodes.
- Critical services run with 2 replicas and anti-affinity to survive loss of the control-plane node:
  - HAProxy Ingress, CoreDNS, cert-manager, Vaultwarden, and the Portfolio site.
- Replica spreading enforced via podAntiAffinity/topologySpreadConstraints.
- Data protection: Longhorn snapshots run hourly; backups are taken nightly to NAS.

## üéì Learning Objectives

This homelab is designed to teach modern DevOps and platform engineering concepts:

### üê£ Concepts Explored:
- Kubernetes fundamentals and resource management
- YAML manifest creation and management
- Basic networking concepts (Services, Ingress)
- Container orchestration principles
- GitOps workflows and CI/CD pipelines
- Kustomize for configuration management
- TLS/SSL certificate automation
- Resource allocation and optimization
- Storage management with persistent volumes
- Multi-environment deployment strategies
- Advanced networking with multiple ingress classes
- Infrastructure as Code best practices

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Linux server/VM with 16GB+ RAM and 4+ CPU cores (you could use less but I don't reccomend it)
- Docker installed
- Domain name with DNS access
- Basic familiarity with Kubernetes concepts

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rrumana/k8s-homelab.git
   cd k8s-homelab
   ```

2. **Install k3s**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install-k3s.sh
   ```

3. **Bootstrap ArgoCD** 
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -k platform/gitops/argocd/
   ```

4. **Deploy Platform Services**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f platform/gitops/argocd/apps/root-app.yaml
   ```

## üîß Configuration Management

### GitOps Workflow
1. **Make Changes**: Modify YAML files in Git
2. **Commit & Push**: Changes automatically trigger ArgoCD sync
3. **Monitor**: Watch deployments in ArgoCD UI
4. **Verify**: Check application status and logs

### Secrets Management
- Kubernetes native secrets with proper namespacing
- Sensitive values stored in separate `secrets/` directory
- Environment-specific configurations using Kustomize overlays

### Environment Strategy
- **Base**: Common configurations shared across environments
- **Overlays**: Environment-specific patches and customizations
- **Multiple Arr Stacks**: Different configurations for testing (arr, arr-lts, arr-lts2)

## üåê Access Points

All services are accessible via clean subdomains:

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| ArgoCD | `argocd.rcrumana.xyz` | GitOps dashboard |
| Homarr | `homarr.rcrumana.xyz` | Homelab dashboard |
| Sonarr | `sonarr.rcrumana.xyz` | TV show management |

| And many more... | | |

## üìã Architecture Decisions

Key architectural decisions are documented as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records):

- **[ADR-001](docs/decisions/001-k3s-selection.md)**: Why k3s over other Kubernetes distributions
- **[ADR-002](docs/decisions/002-metallb-selection.md)**: MetalLB vs k3s ServiceLB
- **[ADR-003](docs/decisions/003-haproxy-selection.md)**: HAProxy vs NGINX ingress controller  
- **[ADR-004](docs/decisions/004-ingress-class-division.md)**: Separate public/restricted ingress classes

## üîç Monitoring & Observability

LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) is planned next and will be added shortly.

## üöÄ What Makes This Special

### Modern 2025 Best Practices
- **GitOps-First**: Everything is declarative and version-controlled
- **Security-Focused**: Network policies, RBAC, and proper secret management
- **Production-Ready**: Resource limits, health checks, and monitoring
- **Scalable**: Designed to grow from single-node to multi-node clusters

### Real-World Applications
- **Daily Use**: These aren't toy apps ‚Äì they run my actual media server, password manager, and development tools
- **Enterprise Patterns**: Same technologies and patterns used in production environments
- **Learning Playground**: Safe environment to experiment with breaking changes
